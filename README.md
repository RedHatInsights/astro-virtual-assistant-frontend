This repository holds the federated modules for Console's virtual assistant (Chameleon).
This can be tested on the landing page.

Note: You don't have to run it anymore with the landing page frontend.

## For AI Agent Onboarding

**See [ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md](./ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)** for instructions on how to integrate your AI agent into Chameleon.

## Getting started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start` or `npm run start` if running on beta/preview.
3. Navigate to the landing page (you're going to get a 404)
4. You should be able to see it on the bottom right. To make changes to the position/alignment relative to the landing page, check out the landing page code.

If you want to run your backend locally, use `USE_LOCAL_RASA=1 npm run start`.


### Static mode

A static mode is provided to be able to host the federated modules:

1. `npm run start:static`
2. Download the landing page frontend code and update the fec config to include these routes.

```javascript
   
module.exports = {
  // ...

  routes: {
    '/apps/virtual-assistant/': { host: 'http://localhost:8003' },

    // Optional. If you want to run a local instance of Rasa add this entry
    '/api/virtual-assistant/v1': { host: 'http://localhost:5005' },
  }
};
```

You still need to complete once the `Initial etc/hosts setup` as detailed in the landing page repository.
After that, you can run `npm run start:standalone`.


### Testing

`npm run verify` will run `npm run lint` (eslint) and `npm test` (Jest)

#### ARH Chatbot Component Testing

For comprehensive testing of ARH chatbot components, see the **[ARH Chatbot Testing Guide](./ARH_CHATBOT_TESTING_GUIDE.md)**.

**Available test commands:**
- `npm run test` - Run Jest unit tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run Jest in watch mode  
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run Jest with coverage report
- `npm run cypress:open:cp` - Open Cypress component test runner
- `npm run cypress:run:cp` - Run Cypress component tests headlessly

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Cypress Component Tests**: UI components, user interactions, accessibility
- **Jest Tests**: React hooks, utility functions, business logic
- **Mocking**: Third-party dependencies (`arh-client`, `ai-client-state`, `ai-react-state`) are mocked to ensure test isolation
